Add Font Awesome icons, or icons from a custom icon set to rich text fields anywhere in the Gutenberg block editor!

== Description ==
Add inline icons to rich text fields like: paragraphs, headings, lists or buttons anywhere in the Gutenberg block editor. I was really suprised nobody seemed to have built something like this before so I decided to build it myself.
